display userName
display userDate


2.
str userWord
userWord = getWordFromKeyboard()
displayWordTwice():
    display userWord + "$$$$" + display userWord

define userWord as a string variable
recieve the user's input from the keyboard and assign it as the userWord variable
display the userWord variable and concatenate it with "$$$$" followed by the userWord variable again

3.
int userNumber1
int userNumber2
int userNumberMultiply
userNumber1 = getNumberFromKeyboard()
userNumber2 = getNumberFromKeyboard()
userNumberMultiply = userNumber1 * userNumber2
display userNumberMultiply

define 3 integers, one for each number (userNumber1, userNumber2) and one for the final result (userNumberMultiply)
recieve the user's number input from the keyboard and assign it as userNumber1
again, recieve the user's number input from the keyboard, but assign it as userNumber2
multiply userNumber1 and userNumber2 together and assign it to userMultiply
display userMultiply

4.
int userNumber1
int userNumber2
int userNumberAdd
int userNumber1Add
int userNumber2Add
int userNumberFinalAdd

userNumber1 = getNumberFromKeyboard()
userNumber2 = getNumberFromKeyboard()
displayUserNumbers1():
    print "userNumber1" + " " + "userNumber2"
    print userNumber1 + userNumber2
userNumber1Add = userNumber1 + 10
userNumber2Add = userNumber2 + 20
displayUserNumbers2():
    print "userNumber1Add" + " " + "userNumber2Add"
userNumberFinalAdd = userNumber1Add + userNumber2Add
displayUserNumberFinalAdd():
    print userNumberFinalAdd

define variables for each stage of the number (userNumber1, userNumber2) and number additions (userNumberAdd, userNumber1Add, userNumber2Add, userNumberFinalAdd)
recieve the user's number input from the keyboard and assign it as userNumber1
recieve the user's number input from the keyboard and assign it as userNumber2
display both userNumber1 and userNumber2, with a space between them so that they are readable
